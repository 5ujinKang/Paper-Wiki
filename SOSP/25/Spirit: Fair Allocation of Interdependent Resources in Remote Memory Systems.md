## During the meeting
- Existing HW really suffers from fundamental limitations -> modify HW
- Highlevel Design : micro-economy theory <- selling paper
- Lowlevel Design : 1) Profile -> 2) Estimation (sec 4.2) -> 3) Symboisis algorithm (sec 3.2) -> 4) Property guarantee (sec 3.1)
- If we want to do something that is not conventional -> Bring a new problem definition
- Even with the same item, if we find some good, right usecase, we can create value
- Estimation is not that useful : factor "slowdown" is not something actually we can use
- out-of-order writing
- Limitation: Fairness -> performance improvement (since paper showed with the result- but 21.6% = not high improvement). Does Fairness matters to performance
- Difficult to improve performance through resource reallocation -> but maybe can do that certain domain.
- Can we go beyond the performance model? : 1) take app feedback, 2) what if we do in Data center? 
- Take app feedback != application modification
- Data Center has : code access, program ananlysis & performance.
- Even the scope is limited -> having guarantee can be more valuable to academia contribution since we can expand it later.
