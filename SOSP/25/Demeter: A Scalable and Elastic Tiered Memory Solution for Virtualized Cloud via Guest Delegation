# Background
DRAM is a scalability bottleneck. The increasement speed of maximum mem capacity is smuch slower than cpu increasement.
- CPU core count increased 15 -> 144
- But maximum memory capacity increased 1.5 -> 4TB

## Solution
Tiered memory Architecture: faster-small/slower-big memory tier -> divide and use smartly
- 

# Problems
For TMM, virtualized cloud infrastructure relies on the hypervisor in the host machine. 
Existing hypervisor-based approaches suffer from significant performance penalties.
- Tracking the Page Table Entry Access/Dirty bits : 
- Processor Event-Based Samplings (PEBS): 

# Key Idea
Guest-delegated tiered memory management

# Solution: High Level


# Solution: Low Level


# Evaluation


# Insight


# Good Points
: have both Architectural insight & Technical contributions
- High Level/ Architectural insight: Delegate 
- Low Level/ Technical contributions: 

# Bad Points
- Emphasize the limition too much
-
