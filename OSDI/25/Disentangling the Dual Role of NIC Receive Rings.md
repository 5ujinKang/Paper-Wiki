# 📄 Title : Disentangling the Dual Role of NIC Receive Rings

* **source:**  [https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi25/presentation/pismenny](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi25/presentation/pismenny)
* **Keywords:**  NIC receive rings, I/O working set, cross‑core buffer sharing, rxBisect
* **Core Idea (inferred from keywords):**  Split each receive ring into two separate rings—one for memory allocation and one for packet reception—to reduce the I/O working set and handle load imbalance efficiently.

<br>

## Summary :

**Background**
Modern NICs use per‑core receive (Rx) rings sized to absorb bursts. The combined set of packet buffers across rings can exceed the LLC capacity, causing cache evictions and high memory‑bandwidth pressure. Reducing ring size hurts burst absorption, while sharing a single ring (shRing) introduces synchronization and load‑balance issues.

**Attack Point**
Current per‑core rings (privRing) have a large working set and suffer throughput and latency degradation when the working set exceeds the LLC. Small rings cannot absorb bursts. Shared rings (shRing) require locking and perform poorly when traffic is imbalanced because overloaded cores monopolize the shared ring.

<br>

**Goal**
Design a NIC‑CPU interface that keeps the I/O working set within the LLC, avoids synchronization overhead, and remains robust under load imbalance.

<br>

**Their Solution**
The paper proposes **rxBisect**, which splits each Rx ring into an **allocation ring (Ax)** for empty buffers and a **bisected reception ring (Bx)** for packet notifications. Buffers from any Ax ring can be used to deliver packets to any Bx ring, enabling cross‑core buffer sharing without locks. The NIC offloads synchronization, so allocation and packet reception are disentangled. This allows small Ax rings and larger Bx rings, keeping the overall working set below LLC capacity.

**Performance**
Using a DPDK‑based software NIC emulator, the authors show that rxBisect improves throughput by up to 37% and reduces packet latency by up to 11× compared to the default per‑core rings. Under load imbalance, it improves throughput by up to 20% relative to dynamic shRing. It achieves line‑rate performance with Ax rings containing only 256 entries, whereas privRing requires 1 Ki entries. The design also outperforms shRing and privRing on the MICA key‑value store benchmark.

<br>

**Limitation**
The paper evaluates rxBisect via a software emulator; implementing it requires changes to the NIC ASIC. Emulation can reduce throughput by up to 12% and increase latency by up to 94%. Cross‑core buffer sharing depends on inter‑core memory allocators; although allocator overhead is low (<0.2% of cycles), it may stress allocator caches when buffers are frequently transferred. The I/O working set can grow if overloaded cores consume more buffers, and hardware support is needed to fully realize the design.

# 🔎 Details

## 0. Abstract

**High‑level Problem statement :**
Current NICs use large per‑core Rx rings to absorb packet bursts; the aggregated I/O working set often exceeds LLC capacity, causing memory bandwidth bottlenecks. Sharing rings reduces the working set but suffers from synchronization overhead and load imbalance.

<br>

**High‑level design principle / key novelty :**
Introduce **rxBisect**, a new NIC‑CPU interface that separates buffer allocation from packet reception using two independent rings (Ax and Bx). The NIC may consume a buffer from any Ax ring to deliver a packet to a Bx ring, enabling lockless cross‑core buffer sharing.

<br> <br>

## 1. Introduction

**Problem statement :**
Rx rings combine two producer‑consumer functions (software allocating empty buffers and the NIC delivering packets), forcing each buffer to be reused only after all others are used. As rings grow or more rings are added, the working set scales with N×R and can exceed LLC capacity, leading to reduced throughput and increased latency.

<br>

**the design principle of the work :**
Disentangle buffer allocation from packet reception so that the number of allocated buffers does not depend on ring size; allow cross‑core buffer sharing without software synchronization.

<br>

**The Overall storyline of the work :**
The paper shows that increasing Rx ring size degrades performance and that existing solutions (small rings, few dispatchers, shRing) are inadequate. It proposes rxBisect to reduce the working set by using small allocation rings and large bisected reception rings, offloading synchronization to the NIC. A DPDK‑based emulator evaluates rxBisect against baseline and shRing, demonstrating improved throughput, latency, and robustness to load imbalance.

## 2. Low‑Level Details

### Background

**Motivation of the problem :**
Network‑intensive applications rely on DDIO to keep up with 100 Gbps+ links. When the I/O working set exceeds LLC capacity, DDIO evicts data, causing CPU accesses to be served from main memory and creating bandwidth bottlenecks. Larger rings require more buffers, increasing the working set; yet smaller rings cannot absorb packet bursts.

<br>

**Background knowledge to understand this paper :**

* DDIO allows NICs to read/write directly to the LLC but only allocates a fraction of LLC ways (two ways in the experiments).
* Rx rings are circular arrays filled with pointers to MTU‑sized buffers; the NIC writes packets at the head and software replenishes at the tail.
* Completion rings (CR) notify software of packet arrivals without polling the Rx ring head.

<br>

---

### Motivation

**How the prior work solves the problem :**

* **Few dispatchers**: Use dispatcher cores with large rings to distribute packets; cannot scale beyond ~40 Gbps links.
* **Small private rings**: Reduce ring size so the working set fits in the LLC; but small rings cannot absorb bursts, causing packet loss.
* **shRing**: Share default‑sized rings across cores to reduce the working set; this requires locks for reposting buffers and can suffer from queueing delays under load imbalance.

**What were their limitations? :**
PrivRing’s large working set degrades performance. Small rings suffer packet loss. ShRing incurs per‑packet overhead due to synchronization and fails under imbalance when overloaded cores monopolize the ring.

<br>

---

### Design

**Design principles :**

* Separate buffer allocation from packet reception using two independent rings (Ax and Bx).
* Allow the NIC to take buffers from any Ax ring to populate any Bx ring, enabling cross‑core sharing without locks.
* Keep Ax rings small and Bx rings large to minimize the working set while absorbing bursts.

<br>

**Design goals or challenges :**

* Reduce the total number of allocated buffers without sacrificing burst absorption.
* Avoid synchronization overhead and allow independent core operation.
* Remain robust to load imbalance so that overloaded cores do not block others.

<br>

**How the design addresses the challenges :**
RxBisect’s Ax and Bx rings have independent sizes; Ax rings can be small while Bx rings remain large. The NIC selects buffers from any non‑empty Ax ring to deliver packets, so buffers are globally shared. Cores process packets independently in their Bx rings, and buffer sharing is performed by the NIC hardware, eliminating synchronization overhead.

---

### Implementation

**Before reading, think of how to implement the design :**
The paper emulates rxBisect in DPDK using a dedicated emulator core that dispatches packets between physical Rx rings and virtual Ax/Bx rings. The emulator exposes virtual rings to worker cores and maintains strict separation of packet buffers when emulating privRing. Implementing rxBisect in hardware would require changes to the NIC ASIC.

<br>

## 3. Evaluation

### Before reading

**Make sure you understand the storyline**
The evaluation tests rxBisect, privRing, small privRing, shRing, and an idealized dynamic shRing using network functions (NAT, load balancing) and the MICA key‑value store.

**What questions should the evaluation answer?**

* Does rxBisect reduce the I/O working set and maintain line‑rate throughput?
* How does rxBisect compare to privRing and shRing in throughput and latency?
* Does rxBisect remain effective under load imbalance?

### While reading:

* **Addressing questions:** The evaluation demonstrates that rxBisect matches or exceeds privRing throughput with a much smaller working set and outperforms shRing under imbalance.
* **Result explanations:** The results are tied to reduced I/O working sets and elimination of synchronization.
* **Suspicious or unclear claims:** The paper notes that emulation may underestimate rxBisect’s benefits and that non‑emulated small privRing is impractical.

<br>

### Key Results Summary:

* **Balanced load:** RxBisect and shRing achieve line‑rate throughput using only 1/8 of the buffers needed by privRing. PrivRing throughput collapses when its working set exceeds LLC capacity, causing latency to increase by up to 11×.
* **MICA benchmark:** RxBisect’s throughput exceeds emulated privRing by up to 37% and non‑emulated privRing by up to 18%.
* **Ring size tuning:** RxBisect achieves maximum single‑flow no‑drop throughput with only 256 Ax entries; privRing requires four times more entries. Increasing Bx ring size does not degrade throughput, unlike privRing where larger rings reduce performance.
* **Load imbalance:** In synthetic workloads with processing variability or traffic skew, rxBisect maintains line‑rate throughput while shRing throughput decreases by up to 60%. When processing an imbalanced CAIDA trace co‑located with compute workloads, rxBisect outperforms dynamic shRing by 16–20% for NAT and load balancing.

<br> <br>

## 4. Limitations / Discussion / Related Work

* **Trade‑offs or limitations:** RxBisect requires changes to NIC hardware; current evaluation uses software emulation. Emulation adds overhead (up to 12% lower throughput and 94% higher latency compared to non‑emulated runs). Cross‑core buffer sharing can stress the memory allocator, though allocator cycles remain below 0.2% of total cycles.
* **Reasonableness:** The limitations are acknowledged by the authors. The need for hardware changes is typical for NIC innovation; the emulator demonstrates feasibility.
* **New ideas:** Hardware implementation of rxBisect could further reduce overhead. Exploring dynamic policies for selecting Ax rings could optimize buffer reuse.

<br>

# 🧐 My Works

## Questions:

* How will rxBisect perform when implemented in hardware, especially at link speeds beyond 100 Gbps?
* Can dynamic policies for buffer selection further improve fairness under extreme imbalance?

<br> <br>

## Learned Knowledge:

* Large per‑core Rx rings can overwhelm the LLC, degrading throughput and latency.
* Separating buffer allocation from packet reception and allowing cross‑core sharing can reduce the I/O working set and eliminate synchronization overhead.
