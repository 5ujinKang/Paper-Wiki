# üìÑ Title : Extending Applications Safely and Efficiently
- **source:**   https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/fried
- **Keywords:**  Application extending, safety, efficiency
- **Core Idea (inferred from keywords):**  Maybe it is suggesting a better way to extend the application safer and more efficient

<br>

## Summary :
**Background**  
 Application extension is very important because it can improve performance, add features, enhance security, etc. 
<br>

**Attack Point**
 But the current tools are neither safe nor efficient, because they suffer from a security-efficiency tradeoff. 
Since every extension has different requirements for security & efficiency, it's hard to optimize the environment for each.
<br>

**Their Solution** 
 Suggest a new model EIM, optimize for each extension, fulfilling their requirements for security & efficiency level. 
EIM abstracts the features of extension by seeing extension as a "resource", and provides a framework to deal with each. 
By fulfilling each extension's requirements for security/efficiency level, it solves the security-efficiency trade-off problem.

## 0. Abstract
- **High-level Problem statement**
  
  *( what kind of the problem the paper is trying to solve, why is this a significant and/or interesting problem, what is the limitation of the prior work)*
  : the current state-of-the-art is neither safe nor efficient enough.

<br>

- **High-level design principle / key novelty** 
: presents new model, EIM and extension framework that enforces an EIM specification, bpftime.
  - Extension Interface Model (EIM) : model that treats each required feature of an extension as a resource
