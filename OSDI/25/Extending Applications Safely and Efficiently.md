# üìÑ Title : Extending Applications Safely and Efficiently
- **source:**   https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/fried
- **Keywords:**  Application extending, safety, efficiency
- **Core Idea (inferred from keywords):**  Maybe it is suggesting a better way to extend the application safer and more efficient

## 2. Abstract
- Problem statement ( What problem does the paper try to solve, and why is it significant? )
  : the current state-of-the-art is neither safe nor efficient enough.
- Limitations of prior work  :
- High-level design principle / key novelty : 
presents new model, EIM and extension framework that enforces an EIM specification, bpftime.
  - Extension Interface Model (EIM) : model that treats each required feature of an extension as a resource
