# üìÑ Title : Extending Applications Safely and Efficiently
- **source:**   https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/fried
- **Keywords:**  Application extending, safety, efficiency
- **Core Idea (inferred from keywords):**  Maybe it is suggesting a better way to extend the application safer and more efficient

<br>

## Summary :
**Background**
Application extension is very important because it can improve performance, add features, enhance security, etc. 
<br>

**Attack Point**
But the current tools are neither safe nor efficient, because they suffer from a security-efficiency tradeoff. <br>
Since every extension has different requirements for security & efficiency, it's hard to optimize the environment for each.
<br>

**Goal**
Suggest the way to extend Applications Safely and Efficiently 
<br>

**Their Solution** 
Suggest a new model EIM, optimize for each extension, fulfilling their requirements for security & efficiency level. <br>
EIM abstracts the features of extension by seeing extension as a "resource", and provides a framework to deal with each. <br>
By fulfilling each extension's requirements for security/efficiency level, it solves the security-efficiency trade-off problem.

## 0. Abstract
**High-level Problem statement :**  
  *( what kind of the problem the paper is trying to solve, why is this a significant and/or interesting problem, what is the limitation of the prior work)*
  <br>
  the current state-of-the-art is neither safe nor efficient enough.

<br>

**High-level design principle / key novelty :** 
<br>
presents new model, EIM and extension framework that enforces an EIM specification, bpftime.
  - Extension Interface Model (EIM) : model that treats each required feature of an extension as a resource


<br> <br>

## 1. Introduction
**Problem statement :**
<br>
- software extension is important : add features, improve performance/security etc
- current extension frameworks are inefficient because they employ heavyweight techniques for isolation and safety
  1. extension safety : trade off between extension interconnectedness vs. safety (deployment specific)
  2. extension isolation : prevents a host appication from harming an extension, necessary for security monitoring extensions
  3. extension efficiency : requires the extensions execute at near-native speed
<br>

**Design principle :**
<br>
**EIM : a new approach for specifying the interface between an extension and a host**
 - Supports fine-grained interconnectedness / safety tradeoffs
 - represent the extension features needed for interconnectedness or restricted for safety through a single abstraction called a resource.

<br>

**bpftime : a new extension runtime system**
- support EIM & extension isolation
1. uses lightweight approaches : provide extension safety & isolation
    - for safety : Uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) style verification => 0 runtime overhead
    - for isolation : uses ERIM-style intraprocess hardware-supported isolation => minimal overhead
2. introduces concealed extention entries : improve efficiency by eliminating runtime overhead from extension entries that are not in use by a running process
- fully compatible with with eBPF -> can extend both the kernel & applications
