# Summary

## 1. Validating the Storyline
**Check each step logically:**
- Does the target problem really exist and matter?  
- Is it significant and timely?  
- Is there missing related work?  
- Are prior work limitations important and inherent?  
- Does the design really solve those limitations?  
- Does each design point contribute to solving the problem?  
- Are the evaluation baselines fair and complete?  
- Do results validate each claim?  
- Are explanations reasonable?  
- Are trade-offs justified?


## 2. Learn from the Writing
**High-Level Writing (Storyline):**  
- Would I position or organize the storyline differently?  
- Would reordering sections or changing focus help clarity?  
- Should certain sections be longer or shorter?  

**Low-Level Writing (Details):**  
- Which parts were *very clear* — why?  
- Which parts were *confusing* — how would I improve them?  
- What writing or presentation techniques stood out (good or bad)?  


# 3. How the Paper Helps My Own Work
**Learned Knowledge:**  
- New scenario / problem  
- New design principle(s)  
- New techniques  

**Ideas or Inspirations:**  
- What trade-offs are interesting?  
- Can I make a different trade-off?  
- Can I apply a different design principle to a similar problem?  
- What if I add new goals (e.g., reliability, security)?  
- What if I explore co-designs (e.g., hardware offloading, smartNICs, smartSSDs)?
